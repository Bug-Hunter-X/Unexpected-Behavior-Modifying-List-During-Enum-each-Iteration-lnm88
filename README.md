This example demonstrates a common pitfall in Elixir when working with lists: attempting to modify a list while iterating over it using `Enum.each`.  Elixir lists are immutable, meaning that operations like `List.delete` create a *new* list instead of modifying the original list in place.  The `Enum.each` function iterates over the *original* list, not the modified list. The solution shows the correct way to achieve the desired result.
